                <p>he changing work ofchildren. As homes shifted from centers of production to centers of consumption, the role of children reversed. Prior to modernization, children shared much of the hard work of family life, laboring with their parents. Work was considered good for them, part of education for adulthood. When children began to accompany parents to factories, profit-driven manu-facturers saw them as a cheap source of labor. It became more common for children than mothers to provide additional family income. Sometimes children could even find work when their fathers could not. Lacking parental supervision at the workplace, they were subject to abuses, giving rise to the child labor movements that aimed to protect the ‚Äúthousands of boys and girls once employed in sweat shops and factories‚Äù from ‚Äúthe grasp-ing greed of business‚Äù (McKeever, 1913, p. 137). </p>
              <h3>I hope that we understand that, while having a garden, for instance, is often useful in reducing food costs and making available delicious fresh fruits and vegetables, it does much more than this. Who can gauge the value of that special chat between daughter and Dad as they weed or
                water the garden? . . . And how do we measure the family togetherness and cooperating that must accompany successful canning? (1977, p. 78).
