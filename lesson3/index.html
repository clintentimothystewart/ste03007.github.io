      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        My purpose for this site is to create a place that is secure for
        families to share there photo's. Having a place were you and your family
        can at anytime add pictures to an album securly can be fun. Security in
        personal photos of your loved one's is the main focus of this web page.
        Being able to not worry about who might be accessing your family album.
        Focusing on building a huge album together so everyone can share the
        memories all at once Is the goal. Security is an issue, and many people
        worry about this all around the world. That is why is its number one and
        the main focus here. Beyond security we also want to make sure that we
        still have convienience. Meaning the highest and latest technology that
        is allowed with high security. This balance between convenience and
        security has to be reviewed often to maintain the integrity and delivery
        of the primary goal. I am a computer programmer. I design websites for
        family albums. I am creating long-lasting memories that can be accessed
        by your loved ones at any place or time—using advanced technology
        without the worry of personal information being used to make money. I
        put together websites that are a photo album that only family members
        can access. Families are allowed quick access to memories for everyone
        in one place that is protected. Have you ever wanted to access pictures
        you no longer had access to in your own family? Now you will be able to
        access print quickly and securely see any family albums. Access is
        permitted only by your family, so it is secure. Putting your photo’s in
        most places is a security risk. You have the opportunity to add photos
        and make comments on a digital family album. You can also print pictures
        for your keeping. Responses: 1. Wasn’t sure if the idea had already been
        done. But liked putting photo’s in one place. 2. Didn’t think it solve
        any problems, thought we already had this with other companies. 3. Liked
        the idea of having a website done professionally for a family album. But
        wasn’t sure if one person could handle lots of accounts.
